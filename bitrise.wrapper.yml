  This wrapper is configure in bitrise.io editor as the script to run. What it
  does mainly is to simply clone the repository and forward the execution of the
  workflow to the real build file (bitrise.yml) which is hosted in this repository.

  To work, main workflow here must also be present in bitrise.yml, so main workflows
  must be kept synchronized between the two.

  Also, any change made to this file must be **manually** added to bitrise.io editor.
  Simply copy/paste the content of this file into the web editor and press save.

  To test locally using bitrise CLI, while at project root directory, simply do:

    bitrise run <workflow> -c bitrise.wrapper.yml

  See http://devcenter.bitrise.io/tips-and-tricks/use-bitrise-yml-from-repository/
  for details on the technique.
